# n8n Workflow Collection

This repository serves as a collection of n8n workflows I've created. Each workflow is designed to automate a specific task or process, and is documented to help you understand its purpose and logic.

### 1. How to Use n8n

If you don't have n8n set up yet, you can use Docker to run it locally.
[Here's a guide on how to install n8n using Docker.](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/docker/)

### 2. Repository Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to store and document various n8n workflows. Each workflow is a `.json` file that you can easily import into your own n8n instance.
